        <p>(&#xF824 class)Understanding Climate Risks:
All ten of the hottest years on record have occurred since 2005. <br><br>

(&#xF824 class)Building Climate Coalitions:
Effective climate action will require commitments from a wide variety of ecosystems.<br><br>


(&#xF824 class)Transitioning to Clean Energy
“Electrification of everything” has become a catchphrase attached to the Climate Crisis.
<br><br>
(&#xF824 class)Investing in Climate Action:
Investments in green transportation, sustainable agriculture, and climate.
<br><br>
(&#xF824 class)Sustainable Land Use:
About a quarter of all global greenhouse gas emissions result from agricultural activity on cultivated land.

<br><br>
(&#xF824 class)The Social Cost of Carbon:
The cost of carbon-intensive goods like fossil fuels should reflect the damage.
VOne of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, adopted in 2015 to guide development for the next 15 years, encourages countries to incorporate their climate commitments into national policies, and urges companies to de-carbonize their operations and supply chains. In addition, the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol (on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer) bolsters the Paris Agreement by preventing the equivalent of an estimated one billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year (about 40 billion tons of yearly emissions currently result from human activity).
<br><br>
(&#xF824 class)Green hydrogen:
The COP26 Climate Pact does include provisions aimed at increasing transparency and accountability, and countries are expected to increasingly report on their actions and progress made on climate-change mitigation, on adaptation measures, and on related support that is provided or received. COP27 is expected to take place in November 2022 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, where activists hope more awareness will be raised about the severe climate impacts being felt in Africa, and more related support will be both promised and delivered.
<br><br>
(&#xF824 class)The Developer is in a unique position and can responsibly do our share to minimize climate change while progressing digitization and preparing for quantum computing. Electronics and Industrial technology, otherwise known as simple digitization (the Third Industrial Revolution) have transformed into combinations of technologies and digitalization (the Fourth Industrial Revolution). It is forcing companies to reexamine the way they do business. Mow, digitaluzation is occurring exponentially. Previously it occurred at a linear pace. It is disruptive to almost every industry such as production, management, and governance.We want to minimize this disruption and it's effect on climate change. Climate change affects every facet of our universal ecosystem. Leading to medical conditions such as allergies or asthma exacerbation, pollution, lack of food for humans and resources for animals, deforestation at the rate of 80,000 acres a day. 
 <br><br>
(&#xF824 class)Energy-proportional systems thereby function at peak efficiency, while minimizing waste. Techniques such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, power gating, and workload scheduling are all being deployed in energy-proportional computing in ways that enable significant power savings and distribute workloads across multiple systems, to ensure optimal use. Energy-proportional computing not only improves sustainability by reducing energy waste, it also reduces operational costs - which can in turn boost profitability.
